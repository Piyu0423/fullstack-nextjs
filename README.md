### Full-Stack Next.js Project with Mongoose, MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas), and Tailwind CSS

This project is a full-stack web application built using Next.js, Mongoose, MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based DB), and Tailwind CSS. It demonstrates how to integrate a modern front-end framework (Next.js) with a backend database (MongoDB) using Mongoose for schema validation and Tailwind CSS for responsive UI styling.

## Features

Next.js for full-stack functionality: server-side rendering (SSR), API routes, and static site generation (SSG).
MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas) as the cloud database to store application data.
Mongoose to manage database schemas and interactions with MongoDB.
Tailwind CSS for styling the application with a utility-first CSS framework.
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to interact with the database.
Fully responsive UI design that adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
